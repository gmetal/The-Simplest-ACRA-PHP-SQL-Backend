# ACRA-Simplest-Backend-With-Alterations



# Setup:

You need a PHP MySQL server. Because of the simplicify of all this you can use webhosts like one.com. We're using that and we cannot use any other backends because of the complexity(of the other backends). (NOTE: No SQL database is needed. Do not use index.php or tosql.php in errors/ if you do not have a database)

Once you have the requirements above, simply add the files to your website. Nothing else is required except:
Change the .htpasswd file in the "errors" folder to fit your requirements. Setting up the password: http://one-docs.com/tools/basic-auth

If you are not using one.com, do not use the long link, in .htaccess instead say(if it is in the same folder): .htpasswd

# Using it:

Link to the file called "report.php in the first directory in your java file.

When you are on your computer open crash/tosql.php.

# Features:

* Simple setup
* Easy to use
* You can manually transfer all .txt files into an sql database
* You can view all the entries in the SQL database.
* If your website does not have databases, remove the database dependant files in errors/
* For non-database support, errors/viewfiles.php allows you to see the files. (No delete-function added)
