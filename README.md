# ACRA-Simplest-Backend-With-Alterations

# Based off Simplest PHP ACRA Backend

https://gist.github.com/KevinGaudin/5560305

# Setup:

You need a PHP MySQL server. Because of the simplicify of all this you can use webhosts like one.com. I'm using that and I cannot use any other backends because of the complexity. 

Once you have the requirements above, simply add the files to your website. Nothing else is required except:
Change the .htpasswd file in the "errors" folder to fit your requirements. Setting up the password: http://one-docs.com/tools/basic-auth

If you are not using one.com, do not use the long link, in .htaccess instead say(if it is in the same folder): .htpasswd

# Using it:

Link to the file called "report.php in the first directory in your java file.

When you are on your computer open 'file name is not decided and not made'.

# Features:

* Simple setup
* Easy to use
* You can manually transfer all .txt files into an sql database
* You can view all the entries in the SQL database.
* If your website does not have databases, remove the database dependant files in errors/
* 

However, this backend is not completed yet. I am working on it now and it will be up soon.
