    <p style="text-align:center;">This project is something we made really fast for our apps. By using the Simplest PHP ACRA Backend we<br>
    managed to improve it by adding support for adding logs into SQL databases. This project is still work-in-progress, but it works.<br>
    If you have the time, feel free to add .css files and design to the Github project. We made this not to be pretty, but to be <br>
    functional. ENJOY!</p>
